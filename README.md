# Unixmatica

## How to play

This pack uses Packwiz for managing mods and other files. The official guide on how to prepare a MultiMC/Prism Launcher instance can be found [here](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer/). The pack is hosted at ``https://aproxia-dev.github.io/unixmatica/pack.toml``.

(currently there isn't an official instance provided, see [#2](https://github.com/Aproxia-dev/unixmatica/issues/2))
